## RAG VAULT | Introduction

RAG VAULT is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload PDF or DOCX files, indexes them using Chroma vector search, and answers questions using Google Gemini AI.
The system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure responses are grounded in the user’s documents.

The interface includes document ingestion, chat history, and real-time AI answers strictly based on the uploaded files.
